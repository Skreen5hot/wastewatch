## [Features for the Discerning Overseer]

The WasteWatch™ comes equipped with state-of-the-art features to ensure MAXIMUM efficiency:

*   **REAL-TIME COST ANALYSIS!**
    Watch with grim satisfaction as the cost of your meeting escalates second-by-second. Our patented `Cost-O-Meter` provides an immediate, sobering look at the resources being vaporized in the name of "collaboration."

*   **PRE-MISSION BRIEFING (Configuration)!**
    Before dispatching your personnel, use the simple `Configure` panel to input your mission parameters: assign a codename (Meeting Name), define the resource value of your staff (Avg. Hourly Rate), and list every brave soul attending.

*   **THE ARCHIVES (Data Preservation)!**
    Every completed mission is automatically logged in the Vault-Tec Archives. Review past operations to identify costly patterns. Simply click on any entry to view a detailed after-action report, including duration, total cost, and a full list of attendees. Knowledge is power!

*   **STRATEGIC TREND ANALYSIS!**
    Navigate to the `Trends` tab to view a stunning, phosphor-green line graph of your resource expenditure over time. Are costs rising? Are they falling? This vital intelligence will help you make the sound, tactical decisions necessary for the future of your Vault (and your quarterly budget).
